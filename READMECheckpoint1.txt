SoC project: CNN

Learning Progress
In this period after CNN project started, I got a decent proficiency on Python.
I learned how to use openCV, processing images in it and plotting histograms, scatter plots and other graphs 
using matplotlib. Moreover, reading .csv and .txt files was also taught which was required for processing and analysing
a given data. The very first assignment gave a good start to use some important libraries in python like numpy,
matplotlib and openCV.
I also had a significant progress towards Machine Learning and applied linear regression and
logistic regression in the assignments provided by the mentors. Through those assignments I also
got to learn to train a program to predict the digit represented by an image using both procedures implemented 
by myself and by inbuilt functions in sklearn.
